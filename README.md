Welcome to the Open Morphs project, a open source initiative to provide
libraries, firmware, and apps for the Morph InfiniConnect earbuds.

Currently, the project short-term aims are:

- Convert the original ESP-IDF ESP32 firmware code to PlatformIO
- Begin making tested official ESP32 builds, and flashing at factory.
- Complete `morph-rs` to working state, for companion app.
- Complete `MorphInfiniControl` to working state, dependent on `morph-rs`.
